				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>My Father is Turkish and my Mother is English, in my spare time I learn Turkish as I would like to talk to my Grandparents in Turkey. My hobbies consist of football and gaming. I started football when I was very young at Clifton Rangers after I went to Beacon Rangers then finally Brighouse Juniors. I am a very good listener and work hard when I need to. I began my education at Lightcliffe CofE, then studied my GCSEs at Brighouse High School and finished my A-levels at Brighouse Sixth Form. My interests reside in ICT, this is because I believe that the future will be entirely linked to IT. In IT I like learning code and have got a particular interest in Cyber Security as I believe this will be beneficial to keeping safe in a world that is run by the internet. </p>
